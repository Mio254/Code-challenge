## Description
This project contains three JavaScript programs that solve challenges using conditionals and functions:

Student Grading System

Prompts the user to input student marks (0–100).

Outputs the correct grade based on the range:

A > 79

B = 60–79

C = 49–59

D = 40–49

E < 40

Speed Detector

Takes the speed of a car as input.

If the speed is below 70 → outputs “Ok”.

For every 5 km/s above the limit, it adds 1 demerit point.

If the driver gets more than 12 points → outputs “License suspended”.

Net Salary Calculator

Takes basic salary and benefits as input.

Computes:

Gross Salary

PAYE (Tax using KRA 2023 rates)

NSSF Deduction (Tier I & II)

SHIF Deduction (2.75% of gross salary)

Housing Levy (1.5% of gross salary)

Net Salary

Returns a detailed breakdown of all deductions.
